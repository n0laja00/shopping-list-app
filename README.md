# shopping-list-app

Deno is the runtime I use to run this web application. Deno can be installed from the Deno installation site: https://deno.land/manual@v1.25.4/getting_started/installation

for windows users, use powershell and run ```irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex``` on powershell.

After pulling this application, you should be able to run the application with the command ```deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env app.js```. It opens on port 7777.

Make sure that the app.js is present in the terminal's current directory.

On a successful boot, you'll see the following text:
